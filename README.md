## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project consists of two main components:
- **Frontend**: React/TypeScript application with Vite
- **Backend**: Django REST API for chatbot functionality

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Python](https://python.org/) (v3.8 or newer recommended)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
git clone <this-repo-url>
cd <repo-directory>
npm install
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
```

### Development
Start both servers for full functionality:

**Backend (Django API):**
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 8000
```

**Frontend (React):**
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.
The Django API will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```
The production-ready files will be in the `dist` folder.

## üåê Deploying to cPanel
1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Upload to cPanel:**
   - Download the contents of the `dist` folder (including the `assets` directory).
   - Upload all files and folders inside `dist` to your cPanel's `public_html` directory (or the appropriate web root).
   - Your structure should look like:
     ```
     public_html/
       index.html
       assets/
         index-*.js
         index-*.css
     ```
3. **Access your site:**
   - Open your domain in a browser to view your portfolio.

> **Note:** For client-side routing, ensure your cPanel server is configured to serve `index.html` for all routes (if you add routing in the future).

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization
- Edit `src/App.tsx` to update content, sections, or add new features.
- Styles are managed with Tailwind CSS in `src/index.css` and `tailwind.config.js`.

## üîó API Endpoints

**Request:**

    "message": "Tell me about Amin's experience",
    "session_id": "optional-session-id"
}
```

**Response:**
```json

    "response": "Amin is currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer...",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-20T01:21:10Z",
